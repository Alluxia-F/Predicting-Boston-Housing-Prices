Predicting Boston Housing Prices Project

In this project, I applied basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. First I explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I splitted the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. And then I analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This enabled me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I tested this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to the statistics.
